# Development Rules

> Source of truth: `/ai/rules/dev-workflow.md`

This is a placeholder rule that points to the canonical rules in the `/ai` directory.

## Quick Reference

1. **Understand** — Read relevant skill files before coding
2. **Implement** — Follow patterns in `/ai/skills/`
3. **Test** — Write tests for every change
4. **Validate** — Run `npm run validate`
5. **Review** — Check against PR review skill

## Key Rules

- Tests required: happy path + error path
- Coverage minimum: 90%
- No `any` types, no `console.log`
- Conventional commits format

## Full Documentation

See `/ai/rules/dev-workflow.md` for complete rules.
